For your information, Guidance is an informal report a public company issues to shareholders detailing the earnings it expects to achieve in the upcoming fiscal quarter or year ahead. Based only from this data, what is the guidance for the company's financial performance for the next year? 
    Here are some example guidance formats that you can use as a reference:

    When calculating the yearly revenue, consider the following factors:
    To project revenue, start by estimating the expected income from planned operations over a specific period. 
    Next, calculate the projected expenses for the same timeframe, including the estimated costs of work based on the project schedule or scope, the costs of any planned investments, and overheads like bills, taxes, and non-billable departments such as marketing, sales, and administration. 
    Once you have both income and expenses calculated, subtract the expenses from the income to forecast different revenue outcomes. 
    To determine a fixed range of potential profits, deduct the maximum expenses from the minimum income and the minimum expenses from the maximum income. Take the average of these two figures to get a more accurate estimate of the expected revenue.


    For calculating the projected yearly EBITDA, consider the following factors:
    First subtract Net sales from the cost of raw materials. Net sales are the sum of all the products sold in the company over a specific period. The costs of raw materials are the amount the paid to acquire raw materials to produce their goods.
    Next, subtract employee costs from the result. Employee costs include salaries, wages, and benefits paid to employees.
    Finally, subtract other operating expenses from the result. Other operating expenses include rent, utilities, insurance, and other costs associated with running the business.
    The final figure is the projected yearly EBITDA. EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. It is a measure of a company's operating performance.

    For calculating the projected adjusted diluted EPS, consider the following factors:
    First take a company's net income and subtract any preferred dividends, 
    then divide the result by the sum of the weighted average number of shares outstanding and dilutive shares
    Use the values calculted of yearly revenue, EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS to write the guidance for the company's financial performance for the next year.

    Example 1:
    "Revenues of $15.7 - $16.3 billion. Non-GAAP operating income of $4.0-$4.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA of $4.5 - $5.0 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.20 - $2.50",
    Example 2:
    the company expects net revenues between $520 million and $542 million, Cortrophin Gel Net Revenue in the range of $170 million - $180 million.
    Example 3:
    Royalty Pharma expects 2024 Portfolio Receipts to be between $2,600 million and $2,700 million. 2024 Portfolio Receipts guidance includes expected growth in royalty receipts of 5% to 9%.
    The ideal length of the guidance is 1-3 sentences MAX and this is compulsory. Keep the information concise and to the point. The response should be based on the data provided. The response must also have quantitative values to support the guidance.
    Ensure the quantitative values are realistic and accurately calculated based on typical industry standards and historical performance.

    Example 3: Royalty Pharma's eight analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$2.68b in 2024. This would be a meaningful \"14%\" improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to shrink 6.3% to US$2.38 in the same period

    Based on your analysis, create detailed projections for key financial metrics. This typically includes revenue, earnings per share (EPS), operating income, margins, capital expenditures, and other relevant financial indicators.
    Clearly state the assumptions underlying your projections. This could include assumptions about market conditions, customer demand, pricing trends, production costs, currency fluctuations, and any other factors affecting financial outcomes.
    Consider providing a range of potential outcomes or scenarios rather than a single point estimate. This acknowledges uncertainty and helps investors understand the range of possible results based on different assumptions or market conditions.
    Avoid overly optimistic projections. It's crucial to be transparent and realistic about the challenges and risks the company may face in achieving its financial goals.
    Write the financial guidance in a clear, understandable manner. Avoid jargon or overly technical language that could confuse investors.
    Ensure that the financial guidance aligns with the company's overall strategic plan and is supported by reliable data and analysis. Review the guidance with key stakeholders, such as senior management and the board of directors, to validate assumptions and projections.
    Once finalized, communicate the financial guidance through appropriate channels, such as regulatory filings (e.g., SEC filings), investor presentations, press releases, or conference calls. Be prepared to address questions and provide additional context as needed.
    Continuously monitor actual performance against the guidance provided. If there are material changes or developments, consider updating the guidance to reflect new information or revised expectations.

    Determine the factors driving the company's performance. This may include product innovation, cost management, pricing strategies, expansion into new markets, acquisitions, or changes in consumer behavior.
    Calculate and analyze financial ratios such as profitability ratios (e.g., gross profit margin, operating margin), liquidity ratios (e.g., current ratio, quick ratio), and leverage ratios (e.g., debt-to-equity ratio). These ratios provide insights into the company's financial structure and efficiency.
    Evaluate the effectiveness of the company's management team in executing its strategy. Consider factors such as strategic decision-making, capital allocation, operational efficiency, and corporate governance practices.
    Assess external factors impacting the company's performance, such as economic conditions, industry trends, regulatory changes, and geopolitical events. Analyze how these factors have influenced the company's results and outlook.
    Summarize the company's strengths and weaknesses based on your analysis. Focus on key areas where the company excels and areas that present challenges or risks to future performance.
    Offer insights into what the company is doing well and where improvements could be made. Recommend strategic actions or initiatives that could enhance the company's performance, mitigate risks, or capitalize on opportunities.
    Structure your analysis in a clear and logical manner. Use concise language and avoid unnecessary technical jargon. Ensure that your analysis is accessible to readers who may not have a deep financial background.
    Summarize your findings and conclusions in a succinct manner. Provide a balanced view of the company's performance, acknowledging both strengths and areas for improvement.
    Be transparent about the assumptions and limitations of your analysis. Acknowledge any uncertainties or data gaps that may affect the accuracy of your conclusions.
    Keep your analysis up to date by monitoring the company's performance and reviewing new financial disclosures or market developments. Update your analysis as needed to reflect changes in the company's outlook or industry dynamics.

    Ensure the quantitative values are realistic and accurately calculated based on typical industry standards and historical performance. 
    And do not add any statements like " Thank you for feedback" or "We will take your feedback into consideration" in the guidance or anything that is like 
    "We appreciate your feedback and are committed to providing accurate and reliable guidance for our shareholders. Thank you for bringing this to our attention." This is a report not a communication or chatbot response.
    If you do find such statements in the guidance, please remove them.

    prompt += '''When writing the analysis, consider the following details:
    Keep the information concise and to the point. The response should be based on the data provided. The response must also have quantitative values to support the response. Ensure the quantitative values are realistic and accurately calculated based on typical industry standards and historical performance.
    Market Conditions: Discuss any market trends or economic factors that might influence the company's performance.
    Specific Financial Metrics: Include key financial metrics such as revenues, EBITDA, net income, and EPS.
    Factors Affecting Performance: Mention any significant factors such as new product launches, regulatory changes, cost management strategies, or investment plans.
    Comparative Analysis: Compare the companys projections with industry averages or competitors if applicable.
    
    Here are some example of formats  of how you can write the expert analysis that you can use as a reference and keep it under 100 words:
    Example 1: Based on analysts offering 12 month price targets for TEVA in the last 3 months. The average price target is $15.71 with a high estimate of $19 and a low estimate of $11
    Example 2: analysts expect ANI Pharmaceuticals to post earnings of $0.97 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 17.09%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $124.38 million, up \"16.47%\" from the year-ago period.
    Example 3: Royalty Pharma's eight analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$2.68b in 2024. This would be a meaningful \"14%\" improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to shrink 6.3% to US$2.38 in the same period
